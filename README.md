- **Virtualization:** `VMware`
- **Scripting:** `PowerShell`
- **Remote Desktop Support:** `TeamViewer`

# Introduction

When I met with the client, they expressed a constant frustration of <ins>having to remember multiple passwords</ins> for their online accounts and how long it would take to input their login details due to their <ins>slow typing.</ins> 

They had locked themselves out of their accounts multiple times, due to <ins>mis-entering their password</ins>. 

The client was also concerned about the <ins>security risks</ins> of leaving <ins>password hints on note files</ins> across different devices, including their smartphones and laptop.

### 👤 Client Background:
- The client is an elderly person with limited technical experience, running an independent paralegal business.
- They're looking to integrate digital tools into their existing workflow, with password management being a key concern.
- Frustrations include remembering multiple passwords and security risks of storing them insecurely.

## ⛔ Problem Statement:
Challenges the client faced in managing passwords included:
- ❌ Difficulty in remembering multiple passwords
- ❌ Time-consuming and error-prone manual entering of passwords
- ❌ Security risk of storing password hints on note files to get leaked/stolen

## 💡 Solution:
After evaluating several options I chose `BitWarden`, a password manager offering:
- ✅ Centralized password storage
  - *(no need to remember passwords)*
- ✅ Auto-fill functionality
  - *(no more slow-typing/mis-entering passwords)* 
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
  - *(for web browser/smartphone/laptop - no longer needs to store hints across devices)*

# 💻 Implementation:

### 📋 Assessment/Preparation:
Simulated the client's desktop environment by creating a virtual machine instance using `VMware`. This allowed me to conduct a trial run of installing the Password Manager, to make sure all of its features were functioning before deploying it for the client.

---

### 🔧 Installation/Configuration:
Performed the installation remotely using both `TeamViewer` and `Zoom`. With TeamViewer, I was able to control the client's laptop and smartphone remotely, configuring settings for a more user-friendly interface.

Because TeamViewer lacked a built-in, voice calling feature, I used Zoom instead to communcicate with the client. Providing timely responses to all of their requests and questions.

`PowerShell` <ins>installing Bitwarden using Windows Package Manager</ins> `(winget)`:

```powershell
# Check if winget is installed
$wingetInstalled = Get-Command winget -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Install winget if it's not installed
if (-not $wingetInstalled) {
    Write-Host "Installing winget..."
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.appxbundle" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\winget.appxbundle"
    Add-AppxPackage -Path "$env:TEMP\winget.appxbundle"
    Write-Host "winget installed successfully."
}

# Install Bitwarden using winget
Write-Host "Installing Bitwarden..."
winget install Bitwarden.Bitwarden -e
Write-Host "Bitwarden installed successfully."

```
