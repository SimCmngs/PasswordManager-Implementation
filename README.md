# Implementing a Password Management System - Across Client's Devices

This was a project I completed during my voluntary experience providing tech support for elderly users. This project aimed to install a password manager across a client's devices, enhancing their security and 
streamlining their login process.

# Introduction

When I met with the client, they expressed a constant frustration of <ins>having to remember multiple passwords</ins> for their online accounts and how long it would take to input their login details due to their <ins>slow typing.</ins> 

They had locked themselves out of their account multiple times, due to <ins>mis-entering their password</ins>. 

The client was also concerned about the <ins>security risks</ins> of leaving <ins>password hints on note files</ins> across different devices, including their smartphones and laptop.

### üë§ Client Background:
- The client is an elderly person with limited technical experience, running an independent paralegal business.
- They're looking to integrate digital tools into their existing workflow, with password management being a key concern.
- Frustrations include remembering multiple passwords and security risks of storing them insecurely.

## ‚õî Problem Statement:
Challenges the client faced in managing passwords included:
- ‚ùå Difficulty in remembering multiple passwords
- ‚ùå Time-consuming and error-prone, manual entering of passwords
- ‚ùå Security risk of storing password hints on note files, to get leaked/stolen

## üí° Solution:
After researching and reviewing several options I chose `BitWarden`, a password manager offering:
- ‚úÖ Centralized password storage
  - *(no need to remember passwords)*
- ‚úÖ Auto-fill functionality
  - *(no more slow-typing/mis-entering passwords)* 
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility
  - *(for web browser/smartphone/laptop - no longer needs to store hints across devices)*

# üíª Implementation:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assessment/Preparation:
I simulated the client's desktop environment by creating a virtual machine instance using `VMware`. This allowed me to conduct a trial run of installing the Password Manager, to make sure all of its features were functioning before deploying it for the client.

  - [x] OS: `Windows 10`
  - [x] Web browser: Firefox
  - [x] Online Accounts: AOL, Outlook, Gmail, Metro Bank

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation/Configuration:
I then performed the installation remotely using both `TeamViewer` and `Zoom`. With TeamViewer, I was able to control the client's laptop and smartphone remotely, configuring settings for a more user-friendly experience.

Because TeamViewer lacked a built-in, voice calling feature, I used Zoom instead to communcicate with the client. Providing timely responses to all of their requests and questions.

`PowerShell` 

<ins>Installing **Bitwarden** with *Windows Package Manager*</ins>: `winget`

```powershell
# Check if winget is installed
$wingetInstalled = Get-Command winget -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Install winget if it's not installed
if (-not $wingetInstalled) {
    Write-Host "Installing winget..."
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.appxbundle" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\winget.appxbundle"
    Add-AppxPackage -Path "$env:TEMP\winget.appxbundle"
    Write-Host "winget installed successfully."
}

# Install Bitwarden using winget
Write-Host "Installing Bitwarden..."
winget install Bitwarden.Bitwarden -e
Write-Host "Bitwarden installed successfully."

```
> [!NOTE]
> This script automates the downloading and silent installation of Bitwarden, reducing the manual effort needed to search for the installer and go through the installation options.
